# Swift UI Challenge

The goal of this project is to give you just a "taste" of SwiftUI to familiarize yourself with its capabilities. This project covers the concepts covered in the SwiftUI module. After completing the lesson material and this project, you should be able to:

1) Use the new property wrappers `@State` and `@Binding`
2) Know the basic building interfaces with SwiftUI's view objects
3) Integrate UIKit with SwiftUI using UIview Representable

Your assignment is to complete the following [SwiftUI Essentials tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/tutorials)

1) Creating and Combining Views
2) Building Lists and Navigation
3) Handling User Input

You will download the starter project files directly from the SwiftUI Tutorials website. Each tutorial has its own starter project. In this repo there are three folders representing each tutorial. You can save your project files into those folders following the typical git work flow. 

As Swift is updated, these tutorials become out of date. Below is guidance for directions that have changed from what is shown on the tutorial website.
