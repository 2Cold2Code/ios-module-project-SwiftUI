# Swift UI Challenge

The goal of this project is to give you just a "taste" of SwiftUI to familiarize yourself with its capabilities. This project covers the concepts covered in the SwiftUI module. After completing the lesson material and this project, you should be able to:

1) Use the new property wrappers `@State` and `@Binding`
2) Know the basic building interfaces with SwiftUI's view objects
3) Integrate UIKit with SwiftUI using UIview Representable

Your assignment is to complete the following [SwiftUI Essentials tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/tutorials)

1) [Creating and Combining Views](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views) 
2) [Building Lists and Navigation](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation) 
3) [Handling User Input](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/handling-user-input)

These tutorials guide you through building Landmarks — an iOS app for discovering and sharing the places you love. You will download the starter project files directly from the SwiftUI Tutorials website. Each tutorial has its own starter project. In this repo there are three folders representing each tutorial. You can save your project files into those folders following the typical git work flow. 

As Swift is updated, these tutorials become out of date. Below is guidance for directions that have changed from what is shown on the tutorial website.

(all known differences as of 5/5/20)

* When clicking on elements in the preview with the [cmd] key, the menu item is now called “Show SwiftUI Inspector…” rather than “Inspect”.

* In the Handling User Input tutorial, Section 5, steps 1-6, the tutorial makes it seem like the previews will work the entire time, but in fact, the app gets into an error state after step 1, and doesn’t build cleanly again until after step 6. Just keep moving and it will eventually work.
